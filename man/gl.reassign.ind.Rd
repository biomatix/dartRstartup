\title{Reassign specified individuals to a (new or existing) population}
\usage{
gl.reassign.ind(x, ind.list, new.pop, verbose = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of the genlight object containing SNP genotypes \link{required}.}

\item{ind.list}{Vector specifying individuals to be reassigned. Can be a
character vector of individual names (matching \code{indNames(x)}),
a numeric vector of indices, or a logical vector of length \code{nInd(x)}
\link{required}.}

\item{new.pop}{Character string giving the population label to which the
specified individuals will be reassigned. This value may or may not
already exist as an entry in \code{pop(x)} \link{required}.}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report
\link{default 2 or as specified using \code{gl.set.verbosity}}.}
}
\value{
A genlight object with the specified individuals reassigned to
the new population.
}
\description{
Reassigns a specified set of individuals from their current populations
to a new population label, which may or may not already exist in the
genlight \{adegenet\} object.

This function is useful when you want to manually override the population
membership of a subset of individuals, for example to combine individuals
from several small populations into a single larger one, or to pull a few
misassigned individuals into a corrected population.

The function returns a genlight object with updated population assignments
for the specified individuals. All other individuals retain their original
population assignments.
